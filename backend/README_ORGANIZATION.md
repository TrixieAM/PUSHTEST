# Backend Organization - Status

## ✅ What Has Been Done

### 1. Folder Structure Created
- ✅ `middleware/` - Authentication and upload middleware
- ✅ `config/` - Configuration files (email)
- ✅ `utils/` - Utility functions
- ✅ `routes/` - Organized route files

### 2. Middleware Extracted
- ✅ `middleware/auth.js` - `authenticateToken`, `logAudit`, `insertAuditLog`
- ✅ `middleware/upload.js` - File upload configurations (`upload`, `profileUpload`)

### 3. Configuration Extracted
- ✅ `config/email.js` - Email transporter setup

### 4. Utilities Extracted
- ✅ `utils/verificationCodes.js` - Verification code storage
- ✅ `utils/excelDate.js` - Excel date conversion utilities

### 5. Routes Organized
- ✅ `routes/auth.js` - Authentication routes (login, 2FA)
- ✅ `routes/password.js` - Password management routes

### 6. Main Index File Refactored
- ✅ `index.js` - Now clean, only imports and mounts routes
- ✅ `index.old.js` - Backup of original file (4841 lines)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Route Paths
The organized routes (`auth.js` and `password.js`) are mounted at root (`/`) to maintain compatibility with existing frontend code. The routes inside these files define paths like:
- `/login` (not `/auth/login`)
- `/forgot-password` (not `/password/forgot-password`)

This ensures the frontend doesn't need to be updated immediately.

### Remaining Routes
All other routes are still in `index.old.js`. To make the application fully functional, you have two options:

**Option 1: Temporary (Quick Fix)**
Copy all remaining route definitions from `index.old.js` (starting around line 264) and paste them into `index.js` before the server startup section. This will make the app work immediately.

**Option 2: Proper Organization (Recommended)**
Gradually move routes to organized files following the pattern in `ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md`.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the organized routes** - Ensure `/login`, `/forgot-password`, etc. still work
2. **Copy remaining routes** - Either temporarily to `index.js` or organize them properly
3. **Continue organizing** - Follow `ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md` to move remaining routes

## File Structure

```

└── payrollRoutes/             # Existing (unchanged)
```

## Testing

After organizing, test these endpoints:
- ✅ `POST /login` → Should work (now in `routes/auth.js`)
- ✅ `POST /forgot-password` → Should work (now in `routes/password.js`)
- ✅ `POST /send-2fa-code` → Should work (now in `routes/auth.js`)
- ⚠️ Other routes → Need to be copied from `index.old.js` or organized
